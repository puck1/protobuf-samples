/* Extending a Protocok Buffer:
 * You MUST NOT change the tag numbers of any existing fields.
 * You MAY delete fields.
 * You MAY add new fields but you MUST use fresh tag numbers.
 * (i.e. tag numbers that were nerver used in this protocol buffer, not even by deleted fields)
 * There are some [exceptions](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3#updating) to these rules, but they are rarely used.
